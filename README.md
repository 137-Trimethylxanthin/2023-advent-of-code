# My awnsers of [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com)

## Hello 👋

These are my awnsers to the [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges. 

its my first time doing them, so i hope i hope my awnsers are good enough for you.

I will try to do them in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/),

and if i cant do them in rust i will do them in [Go](https://golang.org/).

## Spoiler warning 🛂

If you want to do the challenges yourself, don't look at the code.

You can't copy the answers because they are individually written for every person (I think). So you can look at my code, maybe it helps you in some way  I will try to keep the code as clean as possible, but I can't promise anything.

But if you really want an answer, you can just build my code and replace input with yours, but I would not recommend this because it ruins the fun and purpose behind the game. But you do you. :) (I will write a build tutorial below all of this and maybe a thing so you can just select the things from the start directory or something like that.)

## few words of encouragement ❤️

I hope you have a lot of fun doing the challenges and i hope you learn a lot from them. I know i will.

And i wish you good luck , and if you get stuck, don't give up. Take a break and try again later (it really helps). You can do it. eventually.
